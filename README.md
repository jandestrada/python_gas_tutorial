# Python Gas Tutorial

Tutorial using python to produce a simulation of gas.


First try the [tute-bounce](tute-bounce.md) tutorial which produces a 
simulationof a ball bouncing ina box. 

Then the [tute-gas](tute-gas.md) extends the bouncing ball code to produce
a model of many colliding bouncing balls which models a gas.
